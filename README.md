Overview
--------

This repository contains the transaction logs of all 49 runs shown in the paper "Adaptive Task-Oriented Resource Allocation for Large Dynamic Workflows on Opportunistic Resources" (IPDPS 2024). There are 3 main categories of workflows: the workflows that are synthetically generated, the Colmena-XTB workflow, and the TopEFT workflow. Within the synthetic workflows, there are 5 subcategories, each representing 1,000 samples from a probability distribution: bimodal, trimodal, exponential, normal, and uniform, as shown in the paper. Within each category, there are 7 logs associated with 7 allocation algorithms: Whole Machine (`whole.log`), Max Seen (`max-seen.log`), Min Waste (`min-waste.log`), Max Throughput (`max-xput.log`), Quantized Bucketing (`quantized.log`), Greedy Bucketing (`greedy.log`), and Exhaustive Bucketing (`exhaust.log`). There are 3 logs that are defective and are denoted with the `old` tag. Otherwise, all logs are clean and used to prepare the figures in the paper.
